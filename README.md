<p>The Astrum Feedback Bot is a Telegram bot designed to collect feedback from students about their mentors. It allows students to anonymously rate their mentors based on their performance, and also provide feedback on why they gave that particular rating. The bot is specifically designed for use within Astrum IT School, a coding school based in Tashkent, Uzbekistan.</p>

<p>The Astrum Feedback Bot is easy to use and provides a user-friendly interface for students to give feedback. The bot uses inline keyboards to present students with options for rating their mentors and providing feedback, making it quick and simple for students to give their opinions. Additionally, the bot is designed to be responsive and reliable, ensuring that students can always access the bot when they need it.</p>

<p>One of the key advantages of the Astrum Feedback Bot is that it provides a safe and anonymous space for students to give feedback. Students do not have to worry about any negative consequences for providing honest feedback, as their ratings and feedback are not linked to their identities. This encourages students to be more honest and open about their experiences, which in turn helps mentors to improve and provide better support to their students.</p>

<p>Overall, the Astrum Feedback Bot is an effective tool for collecting feedback from students in a safe and anonymous way. It provides a valuable resource for mentors and the school administration to improve the quality of education and support provided to students, helping to create a better learning environment for everyone.</p>
